# ScriptProfiler helps you track where your code is slow

It provides:

- Code lines that impact your code speed.
- Visualisation of slow code lines for quick fix.

# Setup

Python 3.9
Require matplotlib.pyplot, numpy

from speed_testpy import ScriptProfilerPy

ScriptProfilerPy().Profiler(filepath="your_py_file_totest_path", erase_line=True)

'If the program fails, try again with Profiler(filepath, erase_line=True)

**Your script will be executed as a standard python import**

# Output:

![ScriptProfilerPy](https://github.com/Lucas-BLP/ScriptProfilerPy/blob/master/code_profile_output.png)

# How it works:

Provide the python script path
The module will insert datetime() variable at each non-indented line.

- Your code is opened, read and duplicated
- New lines of code are inserted with timestamps
- A new file is created with the name extension "\_STP".

A python script "SpeedTestPy (STP)" file is created that is, your code + timestamps.

Add lines of code to keep track of execution time between each line of your code.
Add lines of code to plot the performance as a bar chart.

At the end the module execute your file.
Total time display is then, the time taken by your code to run entirely.
